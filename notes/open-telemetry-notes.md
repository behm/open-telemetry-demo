# OpenTelemetry

## Signals

### Traces

- Traces represent a single transaction, or journey, through a distributed system
- Correlation IDs can be used to track traces across your traces
- Helps you discover causality

### Metrics

- Metrics are numeric measurements and and recordings of system state
- Alerts can be put in place to notify various people who are interested

### Logs

- Point in time recordings


## Context and Correlation

Context is what makes data relevant

- SLAs, SLOs, and Incident Response
- Engineers need correlated data to move quickly from triage to mitigation.
- Context helps describe the relationship between system operations and telemetry


## Questions

- What is the difference between traces and logs?
